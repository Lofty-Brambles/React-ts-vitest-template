# [ ✨ ] A Vite template App! [ ✨ ]

A boiler-plate setup for React-Vite, with TypeScript support! 
The community templates lacked a general structure, so I made one for my own use!



## Features

- 🚀 | React with Vite!
- 🎉 | Typescript support!
- 🧪 | Vitest for testing!
- 🥽 | Modular SCSS setup!
- 🦋 | ESLint-Prettier with husky and lint-staged!
- 🗺 | React-router-dom@v6 and React Icons!

## Installations

- Method 1: Clone the repo and run `npm i`.
- Method 2: Run the command `npx degit Lofty-Brambles/React-ts-vitest-template#main [Project Name]` on your terminal.

It should all work. Please do inform if there is an issue.
